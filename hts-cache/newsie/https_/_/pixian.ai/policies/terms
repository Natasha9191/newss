Effective Date: May 25, 2018. 
</p>
<h2>Pixian.AI and Cedar Lake Ventures, Inc.</h2>
<p>
Pixian.AI is owned and operated by Cedar Lake Ventures, Inc.. This is why there are a lot of references to Cedar Lake Ventures below and very few to Pixian.AI. 
</p>
<h3>PIXIAN.AI TERMS OF USE</h3>
<p>
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot; OR &quot;TERMS OF USE&quot;) CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SERVICES OFFERED BY CEDAR LAKE VENTURES, INC.. (&quot;COMPANY&quot;). THIS AGREEMENT SETS FORTH THE LEGALLY BINDING TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR YOUR USE OF THE VARIOUS WEBSITES OWNED AND OPERATED BY COMPANY , INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE PIXIAN.AI WEBSITE AND DOMAIN NAME (&quot;SITES&quot;), AND ANY OTHER FEATURES, CONTENT, OR APPLICATIONS OFFERED FROM TIME TO TIME BY THE COMPANY IN CONNECTION THEREWITH (COLLECTIVELY &quot;SERVICE&quot;). BY USING THE SITES OR SERVICE IN ANY MANNER, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO VISITING OR BROWSING THE SITES, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT. THIS AGREEMENT APPLIES TO ALL USERS OF THE SITES OR SERVICE.
</p>
<h3>Acceptance of Terms</h3>
<p>
The Service is offered subject to acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein (the &quot;Terms of Use&quot;) and all other operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published from time to time on the Sites by Company. In addition, some services offered through the Service may be subject to additional terms and conditions promulgated by Company from time to time; your use of such services is subject to those additional terms and conditions, which are incorporated into these Terms of Use by this reference.
<br>
<br>The Service is available only to corporations and to individuals who are at least 18 years old. You represent and warrant that if you are an individual, you are of legal age to form a binding contract and are at least 18 years old, and that all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful. Company may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer the Service to any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria at any time. This provision is void where prohibited by law and the right to access the Service is revoked in such jurisdictions.
</p>
<h3>Modification of Terms of Use</h3>
<p>
Company reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace any of the Terms of Use, or change, suspend, or discontinue the Service (including without limitation, the availability of any feature, database, or content) at any time by posting a notice on the Sites or by sending you an email. Company may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Service without notice or liability. It is your responsibility to check the Terms of Use periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of any changes to the Terms of Use constitutes acceptance of those changes.
</p>
<h3>Registration</h3>
<p>
As a condition to using certain aspects of the Service, you will be required to register with Company and submit a valid email address (&quot;Company User ID&quot;) and select a password. You shall provide Company with accurate, complete, and updated registration information. You shall not register for multiple accounts. If you need to change your email address, contact Company using the options available on the Website. Failure to follow these rules shall constitute a breach of the Terms of Use, which may result in immediate termination of your Company account. You shall not (i) select or use as a Company User ID an email address of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; (ii) use as a Company User ID an email address subject to any rights of a person other than you without appropriate authorization; or (iii) use as a Company User ID an email address that is otherwise offensive, vulgar or obscene; or (iv) use as a Company User ID an email address where you cannot receive email. Company reserves the right to refuse registration of, or cancel a Company User ID in its sole discretion. You are solely responsible for activity that occurs on your account and shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Company password. You shall never use or attempt to access another user&#39;s account without such other user&#39;s express permission. You will immediately notify Company in writing of any unauthorized use of your account, or other account related security breach of which you are aware.
</p>
